## CSS Features Implemented

### Selectors Used
- Class selectors (`.nav-links`, `.service-card`)
- Descendant selectors (`nav ul li a`)
- Pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`)
- Attribute selectors (`input[type="text"]`)

### Layout Systems
- **Flexbox**:
  - Navigation menu
  - Home page layout (intro + sidebar)
  - Form element arrangement
- **CSS Grid**:
  - Services page card layout (2Ã—2 grid)
  - Responsive grid adjustments at breakpoints

### Responsive Design
- Media queries at 3 breakpoints:
  1. `max-width: 1024px` (tablet landscape)
  2. `max-width: 768px` (tablet portrait)
  3. `max-width: 480px` (mobile)
- Responsive images (`max-width: 100%`)
- Fluid typography using `rem` units

### Animations & Transitions
- `@keyframes` animation for hero section fade-in
- Hover transitions for:
  - Navigation links (color change)
  - Service cards (lift effect)
  - Form buttons (background color change)
- Focus transitions for form inputs
